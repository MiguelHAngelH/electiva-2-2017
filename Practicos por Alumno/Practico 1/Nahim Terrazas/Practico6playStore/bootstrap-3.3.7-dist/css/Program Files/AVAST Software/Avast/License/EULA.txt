This is a legally binding contract with Avast Software s.r.o. (a company formed under the laws of the Czech Republic) in respect of Solutions branded “AVAST”, AVG Netherlands BV (a company formed under the laws of The Netherlands) in respect of Solutions branded “AVG”, or Privax Limited (a company formed under the laws of England and Wales) in respect of Solutions branded “HIDE MY ASS!” or “HMA!” (Avast Software s.r.o., AVG Netherlands BV and Privax Limited, as applicable, being individually “Vendor”). By assenting electronically, installing the Solution or using the Solution, you accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any entity or individual you represent or for whose Device you acquire Solutions from Vendor (collectively “you”). If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not continue the installation process and delete or destroy all copies of the Solution in your possession.
This Agreement relates to your use of certain software or services (including any upgrades or updates thereto) provided by Vendor (each, a “Solution”) and any related Documentation. In this Agreement, “Documentation” means any user manuals and instructions Vendor provides with the Solution; and “Applicable Conditions” means collectively the Subscription Term together with the types of Devices, Permitted Number of Devices, other limitations described by Section 2, the Documentation or the transaction documents under which you acquired the Solution. This Agreement supersedes and replaces any other agreement you previously entered into with respect to a prior version of the Solution.
Vendor may amend this Agreement at any time by notice provided to you in accordance with this Agreement, and your continued use of, or decision not to seek a refund for, any Solution at any point at least 30 days after the notice date will constitute your acceptance of the amendment of this Agreement. Vendor may require that you accept the amended Agreement in order to continue using Solutions you have previously purchased. If you decline to accept the amendment of this Agreement, Vendor may terminate your use of the affected Solutions, in which case you may obtain a refund of the Fees for the Solutions (prorated for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Term) by following the instructions at https://www.avast.com/en-us/faq.php?article=‌AVKB24#idt_0440 (where Vendor is Avast Software s.r.o) or https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l‌=en&urlName=What-is-AVG-refund-policy (where Vendor is AVG Netherlands BV) or www.hidemyass.com/legal/refunds (where Vendor is Privax Limited). 

1. LICENSE
Vendor grants to you a non-exclusive license to use the Solution and the Documentation for the agreed period indicated in the Applicable Conditions, including any extensions or renewals (the “Subscription Term”), provided that you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2. PERMITTED USE OF THE SOLUTION
2.1.

       2.1.1. in the case of Solutions that Vendor designates for corporate, commercial or business use (each, a “Business Solution”), by you or your affiliates (those entities controlling you, controlled by you or under common control with you) for internal business purposes. In the event of any such use of the Business Solution by your affiliates, you are responsible for your affiliates’ compliance with this Agreement, and a breach by an affiliate will be deemed a breach by you. Any obligations of Vendor under this Agreement will be owed solely to you and not your affiliates that use the Business Solution under this Agreement.

Updates will be deemed a part of the Solution for all purposes under this Agreement. Updates may include both additions to, and removals of, any particular features or functionality offered by a Solution or may replace it entirely, and Vendor will determine the content, features and functionality of the updated Solution in its sole discretion. Vendor or your Device is not required to offer you the option to decline or delay updates, but in any event you may need to download and permit installation of all available updates to obtain maximum benefit from the Solution. Vendor may stop providing support for a Solution until you have accepted and installed all updates. Vendor in its sole discretion will determine when and if updates are appropriate and has no obligation to make any updates available to you. Vendor in its sole discretion may stop providing updates for any version of the Solution other than the most current version, or updates supporting use of the Solution in connection with any versions of operating systems, email programs, browser programs and other software with which the Solution is designed to operate.

To make a warranty claim, you must follow the instructions provided by the source from which you purchased the Solution.

6.4. Vendor disclaims all liability for the Solution, including any loss or liability resulting from lost or compromised data caused by the Solution. Vendor does not make any warranty that your data will be stored safely or securely.

You acknowledge and agree to such changes to your Device that may occur as a result of your use of the Solution. The Solution is not fault-tolerant and as such is not designed for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance.

TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO CASE WILL VENDOR’S, ANY MEMBER OF VENDOR GROUP, OR THEIR DISTRIBUTORS’ OR AGENTS’ LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE EXCEED THE GREATER OF FIVE U.S. DOLLARS (US$5.00) OR THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SOLUTION FOR THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION TERM.
6.6. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY OF VENDOR, MEMBERS OF VENDOR GROUP, AND THEIR DISTRIBUTORS AND AGENTS DO NOT LIMIT THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY OR FRAUD BEYOND THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS.

8. TERMINATION
This Agreement will immediately terminate upon your breach of any obligation contained herein (including any breach of your obligations in Sections 2, 5 or 9 which will result in forfeiture of any rights you may have to receive updates to the Solution or a refund of Fees). Vendor reserves the right to any other remedies available under law in the event your breach of this Agreement adversely affects Vendor or its distributors or agents. The limitations of liability and disclaimers of warranty and liability for damages contained herein will survive termination of this Agreement. No provision hereof will be deemed waived unless such waiver will be in writing and signed by Vendor. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. 

9. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS
All Solutions qualify as “commercial items,” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire such Solutions and related Documentation with only those rights set forth herein that apply to non-governmental customers. Use of such Solutions and related Documentation constitutes agreement by the government entity that the computer software and computer software documentation is commercial, and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.

10. EXPORT CONTROLS
You must comply with all applicable U.S. and international laws governing export and re-export of the Solutions, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing: (i) you represent that you are not a member of any of the denied person list, unverified list, entity list, specially designated nationals list, debarred list or any other lists published by the U.S. Government; and (ii) you will not use, export or re-export the Solution to territories, destinations, companies or individuals in violation of U.S. and E.U. embargoes or trade sanctions. You will indemnify, defend and hold Vendor harmless from and against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding, and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising from your failure to comply with this Section 10.

11. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
11.1. This Section 11 applies to any Dispute arising from or related to a Solution or this Agreement and involving you and any Vendor Group company. “Dispute,” for purposes of this Section 11, means any dispute, action, or other controversy regardless of the particular cause of action(s) asserted (i.e., it encompasses, among any other potential cause of action or legal basis, claims for breach of contract, fraud, and violation of statute or regulation).
11.2. In the event of a Dispute, you must provide Vendor with a notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by email to Vendor at legal@avast.com (stating Subject: Section 11 Notice of Dispute Under EULA).
11.3. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS. 
11.4. If you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. Except as provided in below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
11.5. The arbitration requirement of this Section 11 is subject to the following exceptions:
       11.5.1. You may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. If you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.
       11.5.2. All Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor’s intellectual property will be resolved in court.
11.6. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “Consumer Procedures”) and will be subject to the following: 
       11.6.1. The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor). If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer. Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs. If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.
       11.6.2. Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties. However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision. This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures. You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call. However, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.
       11.6.3. You and Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes. If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures.
       11.6.4. If one or more parts of this Section 11 are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section 11 and all other provisions of this Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of Santa Clara, California. For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the California courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.
11.7. Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, if you purchased a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “Commercial Procedures”). The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding. However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.

12. GOVERNING LAW 
The laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement and your use of the Solution and the Documentation. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 

13. GENERAL

No waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement on the part of either party will be effective for any purpose whatsoever unless such waiver is in writing and signed by such party.

Amazon does not have any responsibility or liability related to compliance or non-compliance by Vendor or you with the Default EULA Terms.

Assurance Plans are sold together with certain Vendor antivirus Solutions or other security Solutions (each, a “Security Solution”), and supplement the protections offered by the Security Solution.
       14.6.2. If you request Vendor’s assistance under the Assurance Plan, and if you and your Device qualify for assistance under Section 14.6.3, Vendor will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you to remove the viruses or other malware affecting your Device. You hereby acknowledge, accept and agree that Vendor’s efforts may not be enough to remove certain viruses or other malware from your Device, and that Vendor, in the course of providing service, may alter, delete or corrupt data on your Device, change Device settings, or otherwise interfere with the proper operation of your Device.
       14.6.3. The Assurance Plan covers: (i) only the Device for which you purchased the related Security Solution, and may not be transferred to another Device; and (ii) only viruses and other malware infecting the Device during the Subscription Term, after you downloaded and installed the Security Solution on the Device, and while the Security Solution was running with up-to-date malware definitions. To receive help under the Assurance Plan, you may be required in accordance with Vendor’s instructions to download and install on the Device a software program (the “Assistance Software”) allowing Vendor to gather information about the Device and its operations, diagnose and repair the problem, and change Device settings. You also may need to follow other Vendor instructions. If you cannot or do not download and install the Assistance Software on the Device or follow Vendor’s other instructions, or if Vendor determines your Device does not qualify for help under the Assurance Plan, Vendor will not provide service under the Assurance Plan. Vendor may (but is not required to) refer you to a service under which Vendor or its subcontractor, for a one-time fee, will provide assistance.
       14.6.4. Vendor may terminate the Assurance Plan without notice if it determines in its sole business judgment that you have requested or received service under the Assurance Plan for a Device not covered by the Assurance Plan, transferred or attempted to transfer the Assurance Plan to another person or entity, or otherwise breached the terms of the Assurance Plan.
